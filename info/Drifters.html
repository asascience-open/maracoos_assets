    <td>These drifters were deployed by a consortium of investigators in an attempts to resolve the transport pathways of New England's coastal current and beyond. Funding comes from a variety of sources to have student-built GPS drifters deployed in offshore waters often with the help of fishermen. While most are standard surface drifters marking only the top 1-meter of the water column, some have 6m by 0.6m subsurface drogues often centered at 15m below the surface. Only the last month is plotted here in the MARACOOS asset map.</td>
