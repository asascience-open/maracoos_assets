    <td>High frequency radar is used by ocean researchers to measure surface current velocity fields near the coast. A Hf-radar system can measure surface currents averaged over 15 minutes as far offshore as 70 km. The resulting surface plots provide a much higher resolution in space than previous techniques like current meter arrays. With a HF-radar system an entire current field can be generated every fifteen minutes. (as shown in the above figure). These vector plots allow mesoscale features , like coastal eddies, to be resolved with much more accuracy than an array of current meters.</td>
