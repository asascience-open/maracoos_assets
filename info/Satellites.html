    <td colspan=3>MARACOOS members own several satellite ground stations that have been directly downloading data from environmental satellites since 1992 and displaying the data on the web in real-time since 1994. These satellites deliver data to the ground stations over 10 times per day. There are numerous types of products that can be generated for the ocean, land and atmosphere. MARACOOS products focus on ocean products, the most popular of which is the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) product which is displayed in real time for multiple areas throughout our MARACOOS study region (Cape Hatteras to Cape May). Additional products include chlorophyll amounts, true color imagery and water turbidity.</td>
