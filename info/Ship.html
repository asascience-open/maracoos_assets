  <tr><td align=justify>The demands for finer scale meteorological services have increasingly required higher resolution observations to initialize and evaluate weather and climate models, applications, and products. In response to these demands, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Research (Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR)) Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) Global Systems Division (GSD) developed the Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS) to collect, integrate, quality control (QC), and distribute observations from NOAA and non-NOAA organizations.</td></tr>
