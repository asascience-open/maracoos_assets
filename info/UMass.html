    <td>Weekly 7-day forecasts are now available starting March 9, 2009. The elements of interest are the large-scale Gulf Stream system, the sub-basin scale Gulf of Maine, and the meso-scale, wind-driven variability in the Mid-Atlantic Shelf region. In addition to six-hourly forecast over the whole region (see below right), two different zoom domains (Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic Shelf) are now available. The modeling system used here is the Harvard Ocean Prediction System (HOPS).</td>
