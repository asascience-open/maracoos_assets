    <td colspan=2>The Slocum Coastal Electric Glider is an autonomous underwater vehicle that converts changes in vehicle buoyancy to vertical motion. A pair of fixed wings provide forward momentum to move horizontally through the ocean. This allows the glider to traverse underwater at approximately 1km/hr or 0.5 knots. While the majority of the glider is reserved for glider mechanics, battery storage and communication equipment, the mid-section is devoted exclusively to scientific payload. A suite of miniaturized physical and bio-optical instruments measuring in situ water properties including temperature, salinity, and the absorption and scattering of light in the water column, have been have been integrated into the glider science payload bay. These instruments, combined with the mobility and global long-range communication capabilities of the glider, are providing continuous, real time information on ocean physics and biology. Energy options range from alkaline to lithium batteries and durations from 2-5 weeks to upwards of several months.</td>
