    <td>Surface ocean velocities estimated from HF-Radar are representative of the upper 0.3 - 2.5 meters of the ocean.  The main objective of near-real time processing is to produce the best product from available data at the time of processing.  Radial velocity measurements are obtained from individual radar sites through the U.S. HF-Radar Network. Hourly radial data are processed by unweighted least-squares on a 1 km resolution grid of the U.S. East and Gulf Coast to produce near real-time surface current maps.</td>
