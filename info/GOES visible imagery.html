    <td>The <a target=_blank href="http://www.goes.noaa.gov/">GOES</a> (Geostationary Satellite) provides the commonly seen views of clouds from space. GOES data is routinely available twice an hour (:15 and :45 after the hour). During active weather situations, the satellites can be placed in rapid-scan mode, which provides more frequent updates.  This layer is provided by Iowa Environmental Mesonet, Iowa State University Department of Agronomy.</td>
