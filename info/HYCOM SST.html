    <td>HYCOM is designed as a generalized coordinate ocean model. It is isopycnal in the open stratified ocean but reverts to a terrain-following coordinate in shallow coastal regions. The global system deployed by the US NAVY employs atmospheric forcing form the NAVy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM). Refer to hycom.org for more information on the general model.</td>
