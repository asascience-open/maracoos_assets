    <td>CariCOOS in support to the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office San Juan (NWS WFO SJU) runs a mirror version of their operational setup of the Weather Research Forecast (WRF). This model setup is based on the WRF Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model (NMM) core. WRF-NMM was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <a href="http://www.ncep.noaa.gov/" target=_blank>National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)</a>. The domain configuration consists of a nested setup where the parent and child domain have a horizontal resolution of 6 km and 2 km respectively, with 45 vertical levels. The model is run two times a day on cycles 00Z and 12Z to produce a forecast length of 120 hours. Boundary and initials conditions are provided by the Global Forecast System (GFS) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from <a href="http://weather.msfc.nasa.gov/sport/" target=_blank>NASA Short-term Prediction Research and Transition Center (SPoRT)</a>.</td>
