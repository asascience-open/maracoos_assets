    <td colspan=2>WAVEWATCH III is a third generation wave model developed at NOAA/NCEP in the spirit of the WAM model. It is a further development of the model WAVEWATCH, as developed at Delft University of Technology and WAVEWATCH II, developed at NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center. WAVEWATCH III., however, differs from its predecessors in many important points such as the governing equations, the model structure, the numerical methods and the physical parameterizations. Furthermore, with model version 3.14, WAVEWATCH III. is evolving from a wave model into a wave modeling framework, which allows for easy development of additional physical and numerical approaches to wave modeling.</td>
