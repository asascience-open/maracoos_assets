    <td>The U.S. Navy Operational Global Ocean Model (NCOM), developed by the Naval Research Laboratory (Barron et al, 1&2) and maintained by the Naval Oceanographic Office, is used as the basis for the OPC Global Ocean SST & Currents Forecast. NCOM is a 1/8 degree mid-latitude resolution model that serves as the Navy's operational global Nowcast/Forecast system GOFS 2.6. NCOM is based on the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) and Sigma-Z Model (SZM) with time invariant hybrid vertical coordinates. The surface boundary conditions for the NCOM model, including wind stress, heat flux, and salt flux are provided by the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS). The Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation System (NCODA) provides the data assimilation for NCOM including SSH, SST, and in situ observations.</td>
