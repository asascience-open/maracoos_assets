    <td>The Harvard Ocean Prediction System (HOPS) is an integrated system of data analysis and assimilation schemes, and a suite of coupled interdisciplinary (physical, acoustical, optimal, biochemical-ecosystem) dynamical models.  The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth Ocean Forecasts (HOPS) covers from Cape Hatteras to Newfoundland and offshore to the Gulf Stream ring and meander region. The forecast system is presently assimilating 3-day composite SST from the Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Laboratory and similar AVHRR passes processed by the MARCOOS group at University of Delaware/College of Marine and Earth Studies.</td>
