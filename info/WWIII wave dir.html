    <td>Wave Watch III (WW3) is a third generation wave model developed at NCEP. WW3 forecasts are produced every six hours at 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC. The WW3 graphics are based model fields of 1.00 x 1.250 to 50 x 50 and are available at six hour increments out to 87 hours. WW3 solves the spectral action density balance equation for wave number-direction spectra. Assumptions for the model equations imply that the model can generally be applied on spatial scales (grid increments) larger than 1 to 10 km, and outside the surf zone.</td>
