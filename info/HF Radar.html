    <td>High frequency radar is used by ocean researchers to measure surface current velocity fields near the coast. A Hf-radar system can measure surface currents averaged over 15 minutes as far offshore as 70 km. The resulting surface plots provide a much higher resolution in space than previous techniques like current meter arrays. With a HF-radar system an entire current field can be generated every fifteen minutes. These vector plots allow mesoscale features, like coastal eddies, to be resolved with much more accuracy than an array of current meters.</td>
